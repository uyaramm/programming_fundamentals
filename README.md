# Programming Fundamentals

The idea of this repository is to keep the exercises Iâ€™ve been working on to consolidate the programming fundamentals studies.

## Exercise List

- [Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the
  numbers 1 to n](./exercise_1.cpp)

- [Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the
  numbers 1 to n. However, only multiples of three or five are considered in the
  sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17](./exercise_2.cpp)
